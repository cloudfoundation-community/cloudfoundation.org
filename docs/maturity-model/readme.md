## What is the Cloud Foundation Maturity Model

> 💡 The Cloud Foundation Maturity Model is a model that describes the capabilities Cloud Foundations are building to meet their customers needs.

The Cloud Foundation Maturity Model is an abstraction of recurring themes in hundreds and hundreds of conversations with organizations that are on different stages of their Enterprise Cloud Journey.

The Cloud Foundation Maturity Model is **vendor agnostic** . While meshcloud GmbH initially created the Cloud Foundation Maturity Model and is a vendor in the Cloud Foundation Platform space, the model is concerned with “what capabilities are offered” and not “how are they implemented”.

## Structure of the Cloud Foundation Maturity Model

In the Cloud Foundation Maturity Model capabilities are called building blocks. The term “building block” emphasizes, that building a cloud foundation is a matter of putting together the right blocks (think LEGO) out of the variety of blocks that you could use. The essence of a building block is laid out in [Building Block Reference](/maturity-model/building-block-reference.md) .

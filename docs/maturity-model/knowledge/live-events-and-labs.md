The execution of immersive Hands-on Labs and Events focusing on Cloud Technology and Best Practices plays a pivotal role in keeping users within the Cloud Foundation engaged and updated. This interactive approach offers unique opportunities for users to delve into specific services or practices, fostering a deeper understanding.

## **Diverse Learning Experiences**

Live events, whether conducted in-person or through virtual conferences, provide participants with a focused exploration of cloud-related topics. Unlike On-Demand Learning, these sessions offer a dynamic environment where participants can actively engage with subject matter experts, ask questions, and collaborate with peers. This real-time interaction accelerates the learning process, creating a rich and vibrant learning community.

### **Tailored Workshops**

Tailoring workshops to address the most relevant and pressing issues is a best practice. By analyzing support requests, commonly asked questions, and previous hot topics, the Cloud Foundation can strategically design Live Events & Labs that cater to the specific needs of its user base. This targeted approach ensures that each session delivers maximum value, addressing real-world challenges and fostering a culture of continuous improvement.

Participating in these events alongside peers creates a conducive environment for collective learning. Users can share insights, address each other's concerns, and benefit from the expertise of subject matter experts present in real-time. The community engagement boost not only enhances individual knowledge but also contributes to the overall collaborative spirit within the Cloud Foundation.

### **Feedback Loop Integration**

To ensure the continual improvement of Live Events & Labs, a concise feedback loop through user surveys and Net Promoter Scores (NPS) is essential. Feedback provides valuable insights into the effectiveness of these occasions and guides adjustments for future events. Incorporating user preferences and adapting to evolving needs enhances the relevance and impact of Live Events & Labs over time.

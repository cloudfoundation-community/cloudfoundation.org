As the Cloud Foundation achieves success and recognition internally, the natural progression is to extend its influence beyond the immediate business boundaries. The concept of Cloud Foundation as a Service becomes a strategic approach to broaden the reach and impact of the Cloud Foundation, incorporating new customers and opportunities into the existing ecosystem.

## **Cloud Foundation as a Service: Scaling Impact**

Transforming the Cloud Foundation into a service model involves sharing successful practices, established standards, and the wealth of knowledge developed within the existing ecosystem. This amplification strategy not only accelerates internal adoption but also positions the Cloud Foundation as a valuable resource for other subsidiaries within the business.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Ecosystem Integration:** By integrating the Cloud Foundation model into other subsidiaries, the business creates a unified cloud approach. This ensures consistency, accelerates onboarding, and fosters collaboration across diverse business units.

- **Leveraging Established Standards:** Utilizing working standards and practices from the existing Cloud Foundation establishes a robust foundation for new participants. This accelerates the learning curve and promotes a seamless integration process.

## **Expanding Presence: Beyond Business Boundaries**

As the Cloud Foundation matures, it transcends its role as an internal entity and actively participates in the broader cloud ecosystem. Participation in public Cloud Native events, seminars, and industry gatherings becomes a catalyst for exposure, learning, and collaboration.

**Strategic Initiatives:**

- **Industry Engagement:** Participation in public events serves as a platform to engage with the broader Cloud Native community. Sharing insights, contributing to discussions, and learning from other Cloud Foundations contribute to the collective knowledge pool.

- **Positive Feedback Loop:** The exchange of practices and approaches with external Cloud Foundations creates a positive feedback loop. It enhances the Cloud Foundation's adaptability, fosters innovation, and solidifies its standing as a dynamic contributor to the global cloud landscape.

## **Towards Leadership in the Global Cloud Ecosystem**

In the advanced stages of this capability, the Cloud Foundation evolves into a recognized leader in the global cloud ecosystem. Hosting its own public events for Cloud Foundations, actively shaping the future of community practices within cloud environments, and being viewed as a trusted and valued resource signify the pinnacle of influence and impact.

### **Attributes of a Cloud Culture Leader:**

- **Hosting Public Events:** Organizing events for Cloud Foundations worldwide fosters knowledge exchange, collaboration, and community growth.

- **Contributing to Community Development:** Actively participating in shaping the future of community practices within cloud environments positions the Cloud Foundation as a thought leader.

- **Global Recognition:** Achieving recognition as a trusted and valued resource on a global scale enhances the Cloud Foundation's influence and impact.

The evolution from an internal success story to a Cloud Culture Leader represents a journey of continuous growth, collaboration, and community building. By expanding its reach and influence, the Cloud Foundation not only elevates its own standing but also contributes to the advancement of cloud practices on a global scale.

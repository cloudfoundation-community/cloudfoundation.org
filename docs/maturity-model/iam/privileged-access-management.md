Common implementations for platform operator PAM: 

- for Azure could be using [Azure AD Privileged Identity Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure)

- "break glass" routines to recover root account access (e.g. MFA + password reset procedures, sharded keys etc.)

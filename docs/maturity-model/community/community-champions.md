An integral backbone of most functional and long-lasting communities is the appearance and/or recruitment of Community Champions. Often, these are the power users and direct advocates of the services that your Cloud Foundation provides, and an invaluable resource to make the overall community the best and most effective that it can be. 



### Build It, and They Will Come

The good news around developing and building out this capacity is that, in most cases, your Community Champions are easy to spot quite early in the development of your [Community Space](./community-space.md). They are amongst the very active users on your provisioned platforms, are usually outspoken and helpful towards others and their questions, and do sometimes sacrifice time in their day to help the cause of making the community better for everyone. 

In some other cases, it is not quite as straightforward, and reasons and incentives need to be created by the Cloud Foundation to spark initial interest from participants to rise up and become a trusted resource. This can take the form of a monthly reward in the form of Cloud Credits or other direct financial incentive, but often a simple recognition as a Community Hero that is publicized amongst the others is not to be underestimated.

### Best Practices for Community Champions

As a best practice, it is recommended to always give reasons and purpose for existing advocates to remain in their status, and consider them particularly when building out the [Gamified Community](./gamified-community.md) aspect of the model. 

Another important measure is to directly involve the community and their champions in decisions of the Cloud Foundation. This will increase the leverage that each and every member has over the bigger picture, but also empower individuals to see the collaborative aspect of the wider Cloud Foundation to reduce potential Shadow IT and other disadvantageous manoeuvres away from the central team.

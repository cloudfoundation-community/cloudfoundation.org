On-Demand Learning resources are an important step in developing the community aspect of the Cloud Foundation, because they offer unique opportunities to offload  and outsource particular steps of the learning process to subject matter experts in the field, while also allowing for the grooming of the capability to get the community to help itself when faced with questions and challenges along the way. 

### Create Efficient Ways to Learning & Business Benefits

Curated learning resources like the ones from [A Cloud Guru](https://www.pluralsight.com/cloud-guru) offer easy entry ways for application and development teams to get industry best practices and know-how delivered in bite-sized formats. Additional benefits include the ability to certify individuals in learning paths on popular platforms like AWS, GCP, Azure, Kubernetes, and so on. 

This can have wider impact on the overall business, as certain partnerships in the space hinge not only on direct contact with the respective vendor, but also have a prerequisite of having certain certifications be held by individuals. 

On top of this, this content is usually updated on a regular basis, so additional overhead can be saved by utilizing these platforms for learning, and also can give alternatives when teams are considering a certain solution or pathway.

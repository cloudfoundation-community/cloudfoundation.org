In order to keep product and application teams interested, motivated, and up-to-date on everything cloud, it is recommended to gamify the experience the Cloud Foundation offers to their customers towards the later stages in the Community pillar maturity model. 

### Be Creative & Stay Relevant

The terminology of a gamified community is far-reaching and goes beyond any vertical in the space dedicated to simply cloud. As a matter of fact, many of the ideas have been developed from many different communities over time, and are easily applied to here thanks to the flexibility and adaptiveness of community spaces as a whole. 

Following are some ideas that have a proven track record to increase engagement, retention, and promotion of cloud communities: 

- A quest-based leveling and achievement system that rewards recurring activities such as posting in a forum, actively solving issues from other community members, providing feedback that makes it into a Cloud Foundation productive environment, and so on

- Leaderboards that keep track of the most active and dedicated community members, incentivize continuous participation, and also are used to determine the winners of particular events or engagements within the community.

- Community Events that yield rewards for participants, and insights for the Cloud Foundation. This could include activities such as Raffles where tickets are won by providing certain actions that benefit the community, best knowledge base article of the month, most upvoted feature request or feedback, and so on

- The formation of user groups that can create an internal team that then receives points for certain predetermined activities that further the engagement of the community

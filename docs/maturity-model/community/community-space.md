During the lifecycle of the Cloud Foundation, eventually a [Support Flow](./support-flow.md) alone will not suffice any longer to deliver all the necessary knowledge and information to the respective teams and customers, and stagnation in growth and engagement of the Cloud Foundation  is a common observation. It becomes important to invest in a healthy and striving community early on, and the best way to get started with this task is by developing a thriving [Community Space](./community-space.md) inside of the business.

### Tools & Common Approaches

Similar to the [Support Flow](./support-flow.md) capability, a community space comes in different degrees of maturity, and one level depends upon the other, and care should be taken to develop and nourish each step over time before moving on to the next, as rushing this might result in the opposite effect of not gaining traction, but also making it more difficult to do so in the future.

#### First Degree

In order to create a sound foundation, it is imperative to choose tools and platforms that are either native to the organization already, or that encourage interaction from the get go. Great examples to get started for this is a dedicated Chat Room or a Forum that enables a direct line to the foundation and other teams and users. 

#### Second Degree

Once a basic community space has been established, it is suggested to create additional touch-points around this to further the engagement and feeling of belonging beyond the respective department or team, and to also learn from each other around challenges and obstacles. Examples for this would be a monthly free-for-all round-table session that takes place in a video call, or dedicated office hours that can give better insights on how the Cloud Foundation operates, what the community is looking for in their foundation, and positive feedback loops on specific key topics that concern the entire company.

#### Third Degree

During the last evolution step within this capability, special community events should be considered that highlight successes & milestones, give opportunities for think-tanks and overarching workshops to keep innovating and improving the Community Space, and honour particular members or initiatives that have taken place throughout the year.

### The Flywheel of Success

In an ongoing effort to provide the community with additional resources and opportunities, strategic partnerships with Cloud providers becomes a foundational capability within this pillar of the CFMM. Not only can partnerships yield opportunities to collaborate internally with development teams and other key stakeholders, but they also enable additional benefits that can further the initiatives and engagement of the community.

### Humble Beginnings

Usually, the easiest partnership comes directly from the Public Cloud Provider that the business has elected as their primary solution. These enable the Cloud Foundation to offer  [Playground / Sandbox Environments](../tenant-management/playground-sandbox-environments.md) in their solution with little to no additional overhead, but enable interested customers to get a glimpse of what is possible, as well as demo functionalities and features that would otherwise be part of an (often strict) budget allocation. 

It is often enough to get in touch via contact form or email and inquire on next steps directly. Alternatively, a dedicated Partnership representative can be engaged to scout out the best way to establish an ongoing connection between the businesses.

### Think Strategic, Think Smart

Further down the line, this capability should also include strategic partnerships with solutions that are actively being used in the business together with the tools that the Cloud Foundation provides. For instance, this can set the foundation for [Live Events & Labs](./live-events-and-labs.md) of these providers for the community, give access to beta features, or otherwise inceltivize the community to learn and engage more with products that are established and used for best practices.

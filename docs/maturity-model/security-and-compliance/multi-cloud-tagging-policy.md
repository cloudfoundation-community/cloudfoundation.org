Cloud Foundation teams who implement [Cloud Tenant Tagging](./cloud-tenant-tagging.md) or [Cloud Resource Tagging](./cloud-resource-tagging.md) often find the need to centrally define and communicate tagging conventions. This is a pre-requisite for shared-responsibility tagging, e.g. cloud foundation teams enforcing tenant tagging but leaving cloud resource tagging to internal cloud customers.

## Best Practices for a Multi-Cloud Tagging Convention

### Establish a Naming Convention for Tags

Cloud Tagging works best when following a consistent naming convention. This naming convention should consider t[he technical limitations for storing tags in cloud platforms](https://www.meshcloud.io/2022/02/07/tags-and-labels-on-cloud-platforms-cheat-sheet-2020/). Namespace prefixes on tags help to separate the responsibilities for maintenance of a particular tag. For example, when some tags are automatically reconciled with a [Cloud Tenant Database](../tenant-management/cloud-tenant-database.md) by the cloud foundation‚Äôs automation systems, giving them a clear prefix helps separate those tags from tags maintained by customers individually.

### Focus on Information That‚Äôs Relevant across All Cloud Platforms

The most common metadata manage on cloud accounts and resources are listed below. Namespacing can be a good solution to enable individual cloud platforms to maintain additional tags that are relevant to their operation.

### Involve All Cloud Foundation Stakeholders

Tagging can serve many different use cases. It‚Äôs thus important that the cloud foundation involves all cloud foundation stakeholders in the definition and evolution of the central tagging policy. 

> **üí°** To resolve unclarity and inconsistencies around tagging, the cloud foundation team needs to have the organizational authority to make a binding decision on these matters. 

One important challenge here is to make stakeholders aware of the consequences that introducing tags has on the cloud customer experience. For example, when every cloud platform wants to introduce a slightly different convention for an environment/stage tag, internal cloud customers will get confused about the differences.

### Consider Backwards Compatibility and Update Procedure

As a cloud foundation evolves, cloud foundation teams will discover the need to define additional tags or change the definition of existing tags. Performing these changes should always consider the implications on existing cloud customers and automation processes. Enforcing the tagging policy via a [Self-Service Multi-Cloud Tenant Database](../tenant-management/self-service-multi-cloud-tenant-database.md) for example enables the cloud foundation team to request additional metadata from existing cloud customers or apply automated data migration to existing metadata. Combined with automation that reconciles cloud tenant and resource tags with this database, cloud foundation teams eliminate configuration drift and gain a lot of agility for evolving their tagging policy. 

### Treat Tags like Global State

[Global state is evil](https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/148108/why-is-global-state-so-evil) because it tends to make system behavior unpredictable. This analogy will be familiar to those with a background in programming. From the point of view of building a cloud foundation tags behave in much the same way like global state in a program. 

One important technique to avoid the downsides of global state is to prevent uncoordinated mutation of this state by assigning explicit responsibilities and authority to systems and processes for maintaining this state. These systems can also enforce ‚Äúbusiness logic‚Äù around updating this state.

Another good heuristic is to try and avoid global state in the first place. For example, a clear [Resource Hierarchy](../tenant-management/resource-hierarchy.md) can remove the need for some kind of tags. Having a [Chargeback via consumption cost allocation](../cost-management/chargeback-via-consumption-cost-allocation.md) process integrated with the cloud tenant database (which is also useful for [Tenant Inventory Reconciliation](../tenant-management/tenant-inventory-reconciliation.md)) can avoid putting extensive chargeback related data into the cloud. Tenant-specific configuration data may be better kept in services like a  [Virtual Network Service](../service-ecosystem/virtual-network-service.md) instead of a `on-prem-conncetivity.cidr:10.0.0.0/24` tag.

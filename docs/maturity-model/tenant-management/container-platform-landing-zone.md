- Many organizations have in-house application development teams. Unless they established DevOps (proper) and have dedicated resources embedded within every application team, providing a central platform bundling infrastructure operations makes sense (internal developer platform)

- Many application teams target containers and kubernetes specifically as an abstraction layer. Reduced vendor lock-in, reasonable abstraction over cloud infrastructure

- Central platform teams can build multi-tenant k8s on top of managed cloud provider offerings (e.g. GKE, AKS etc.) more easily. Should look into this angle first before offering [Kubernetes Cluster as a Service](../service-ecosystem/kubernetes-cluster-as-a-service.md) - it‚Äôs easier to operate fewer bigger clusters than many small cluster

- Caveat: Kubernetes is not specifically designed for hosting multi-tenant workloads, albeit this is usually fine in an in-house platform context with semi-trusted workloads. Some kubernetes based platforms like OpenShift offer better implementations

- Developer experience essentially ‚Äúserverless‚Äù, i.e. no infrastructure responsibility.

- Can ‚Äúaugment‚Äù these landing zones with cloud-native tenant access, e.g. for object storage, cloud-native DBs (Dynamo DB etc.) ‚Üí very powerful

- Alternative is a proprietary fully-managed serverless stack, e.g. AWS lambda, Azure Functions etc. Using containers is optional here, but has advanatages (see toolchain below)

- Landing Zone can deliver integrated [Managed DevOps Toolchain](../service-ecosystem/managed-devops-toolchain.md), [Shared container registry](../service-ecosystem/shared-container-registry.md), SDLC tooling etc.

- Landing Zone should set IAM policies and resource Quotas

- Should include [Private Cloud pay-per-use chargeback](../cost-management/private-cloud-pay-per-use-chargeback.md)

Shared container registries allow teams building container-based applications to deliver their own containers for deployment and consume blessed base images from a central location. Organizations can leverage shared container registries to implement policies for scanning images for vulnerabilities and creating an inventory of software assets. The motivations for implementing a shared container registry can be similar to [Shared VM Image Repository](./shared-vm-image-repository.md) for IaaS applications.

Cloud Foundation teams should consider offering a shared container registry as part of their service offering in the following scenarios

- Your landing zones are enforcing restricted internet access and consumption of public registries is not easily possible

- You have compliance needs around vulnerability scanning, restricting acceptable 3rd party licenses or image archival

- You have a lot of development teams planning to use containers for application deployment and want to boost productivity by providing a managed services instead of each team rolling their own registry

To implement a shared container registry, cloud foundation teams can consider leveraging either cloud-native managed services such as Google Cloud Container Registry or dedicated open source registries like Project Quay.

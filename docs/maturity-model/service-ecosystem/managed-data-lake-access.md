title: Managed Data Lake access
description: >-
  Teams can get managed access to central data warehouses and data lakes to
  combine this data with processing and infrastructure in their own cloud
  tenants. Common usage scenarios are "analyst workbenches" for cloud-native
  DL/DW tools like BigQuery that provide a self-service UI and "advanced data
  pipelines" where teams need to load/query data from the central lake into
  their own pipelines (e.g. different teams building ML models for different
  purposes from common data).

Giving teams the ability to connect to the central DL/DW gives teams freedom about tech stack (not locked into a central processing platform like Spark, instead can provision any tooling they need including serverless) while retaining control (via cost, central policies).

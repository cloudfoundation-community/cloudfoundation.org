## Why a Virtual Network Service?

A virtual network allows resources to communicate with other resources. The other resources may be within the same virtual network, but could also be on-premise or on the internet. All cloud resources need a virtual network, which makes a virtual network service essential.

A virtual network service provides virtual networks to application teams. 

A virtual network service has two inputs:

- a cloud tenant for the virtual network

- an IP address range, often in [CIDR notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#CIDR_notation), which can either be provided by a Network Engineer or automatically by an IP address management tool (IPAM)

A virtual network service creates the virtual network in the cloud tenant. If necessary it registers the IP address range in the organization's IP address management tool (IPAM) thus taking the burden away from application teams.

Given the security implications, networking services must be provided centrally for most Cloud Zones (see [Cloud Zones](../security-and-compliance/cloud-zones.md) ). The virtual network service forms the basis for the networking offering.

## Proven Patterns When Implementing Virtual Network Services

### Implement a Hub & Spoke Approach

Defining a central hub with e.g. configured access to on-prem network is a very common approach for a scalable network architecture. If Cloud Tenants (e.g. Azure Subscriptions) need access to On-Prem, a Spoke network is deployed into the tenant and connects it to the Hub.

### Align with Your [Shared Responsibility Model Alignment](../security-and-compliance/shared-responsibility-model-alignment.md) 

Organizations should strive to make applications go full cloud-native on networking (L7, APIs) or provide strongly centralized services (L3 networking like on-premise).

### Embrace Cloud Paradigm Shift

On-premise used L3 connectivity and often no authN/Z on the application layer. The cloud moves this to L7. Network zones are the most difficult to implement as they have a lot of shared responsibilities and interfaces.

### Shift Your View on Networking

On-premise networks are mostly flat, whereas in the cloud we can do micro-segmentation and networks become very hierarchical with application teams having a lot of autonomy over their subnets

### Provide It as a Landing Zone Module

Virtual network services can be modules for Modular Landing Zones (see [Modular Landing Zones](../tenant-management/modular-landing-zones.md)).

### Make It Compatible with Adjacent Services

Virtual networks are most useful in combination with

- Firewall rules

- External IP addresses

- DNS entries

Most applications need to connect to resources outside the virtual network than their own. The following services need a virtual network as input: 

- [On-Premise Network Connection](./on-premise-network-connection.md) 

- [Tenant to Tenant Transit Networks](./tenant-to-tenant-transit-networks.md) 

- [Cloud to Cloud interconnects](./cloud-to-cloud-interconnects.md) 

- [Managed Internet Egress](./managed-internet-egress.md)

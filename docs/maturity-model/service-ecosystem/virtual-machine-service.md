Teams may lack the knowledge to operate their workloads in a cloud-native environment but may be comfortable with working in a data-center-like environment. Providing these teams with virtual machines as a service offers a stepping stone for bringing lift & shift workloads onto the cloud and exposes these teams to cloud-native practices in a guided manner.

## Proven Patterns When Implementing Virtual Machine Services

### Provide Virtual Machine Services in Tailored Landing Zones

Setting up a Landing Zone for lift & shift projects with some opinionated best practices makes the switch to a cloud-native environment even smoother. For example by setting up a simple virtual network structure out of the box.

### Leverage Existing Services

By ensuring compatibility with existing services lift & shift projects get to benefit directly from their new cloud environment by simplifying operations.

- [Managed DNS Services](./managed-dns-services.md) and [Managed SSL Certificates](./managed-ssl-certificates.md) for access and security

- [On-Premise Network Connection](./on-premise-network-connection.md) for providing or interacting with internal services

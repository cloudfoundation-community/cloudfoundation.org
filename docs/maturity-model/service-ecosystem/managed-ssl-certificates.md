Many organizations run their own Certificate Authorities for internal domains. When application teams run internal services on the cloud, they need to be able to request and manage SSL certificates. 

## Best Practices for Offering Managed SSL Certificates

### Leverage Existing Internal Services

Most organizations already have internal processes for managing certificates, e.g. via an ITSM ticketing system. While a direct and fully automated integration with these systems provides the highest degree of automation, application teams will already greatly benefit from managing their infrastructure services from the [Foundation Service Platform](./foundation-service-platform.md) even if the actual service implementation just sends a service request by email. 

### Integrate with Key Vault, DNS

Certificates always have sensitive private key materials, consider integrating this service with [Managed Key Vault](./managed-key-vault.md) block. Also, integration with a [Managed DNS Services](./managed-dns-services.md) may be desirable to shortcut domain validation etc.

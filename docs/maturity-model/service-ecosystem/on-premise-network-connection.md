TODO: describe IPAM integration



A key challenge with On-Premise network connections is to make them scale

1. shared vm and vm based NAT system; load balancer inside VPC

    1. cloud foundation maintains NAT

1. multiple shared VPC with [VPC peering](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/what-is-vpc-peering.html);

    1.  cloud foundation maintains subnets and VPC for customer projects

1. completely isolated VPCs and projects

    1. [private service connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect)/virtual private connect; consume them even if you do not

1. don't do onprem; use internet with API gateway

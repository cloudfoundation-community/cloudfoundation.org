title: Monthly Cloud Project Carbon Footprint Report
description: >-
  Project owners can view a monthly report listing the consumption-based carbon
  footprint caused by their project’s cloud usage. This enables sustainability
  reporting and gives teams feedback towards achieving sustainability goals.

## About Carbon Footprint Reporting

- explain GHG scope 1, 2, 3

    - sourcing from public cloud provider: most likely scope 3

- explain how cloud providers model carbon footprint

## Proven Patterns When Implementing Cloud Carbon Footprint Reporting

> **💡** Imperfect methodology is not a valid reason to delay taking action. Focus on the big picture, then improve the details

### Integrate with Chargeback Process

Treat “cost to the budget” and “cost to the environment” as equally important to raise stakeholder awareness. Build on [Monthly Cloud Project Billing Report](./monthly-cloud-project-billing-report.md) 

### Build on Established Public Cloud Carbon Reporting

- e.g. Google Cloud Carbon Footprint



### Integrate with Corporate Sustainability Reporting

implementing this capability can help meet regulatory requirements (e.g. EU CSRD > 2023)

### Implement Carbon Footprint Reporting for Private Cloud & Services

> **💡** Future versions of the CFMM model may include these as separate capabilities, similar to [Private Cloud pay-per-use chargeback](./private-cloud-pay-per-use-chargeback.md) and [Consumption based pay-per-use for internal Services](./consumption-based-pay-per-use-for-internal-services.md) (but with carbon, instead of currency)

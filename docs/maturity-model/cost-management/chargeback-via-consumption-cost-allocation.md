Pay-per-use is an essential cornerstone of the cloud computing paradigm. It helps balance the freedom to allocate resources dynamically and at any time with an incentive mechanism for consumers to only allocate resources they actually need.

## Why you should implement chargeback via consumption cost allocation

Traditionally, many organizations tried to leverage simplified cost allocations for IT infrastructure. These simplified models typically pool IT infrastructure cost and then distribute it between consumers on a pooling factor basis. Many organizations break down this split on a business unit or division level only, making it difficult to track the individual resource consumption of an IT system.

It‚Äôs also important to consider how often this cost allocation and chargeback happens. Most IT controlling departments implement shared cost or pooling models on a ‚Äúex post‚Äù basis, simply accumulating and then distributing all the cost incurred in a quarter or financial year. Product owners responsible for IT systems thus have a slow feedback loop about the actual resource consumption and cost their systems incur. And more often than not, the engineers actually making resource allocation decisions never get to see these cost reports and thus have little incentive to actually optimize a systems resource usage.

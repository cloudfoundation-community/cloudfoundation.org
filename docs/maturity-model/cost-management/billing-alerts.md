## Why Billing Alerts Are Essential

Cloud costs can quickly spiral out of control due to unexpected resource usage, misconfigurations, or even security incidents. Cloud foundation teams must implement billing alerts to help application teams detect cost anomalies early and prevent budget overruns.

Key reasons for setting up billing alerts:

- **Early Detection of Anomalies**: Alerts notify teams when spending exceeds predefined thresholds, allowing quick investigation and mitigation.

- **Budget Adherence**: Teams can proactively manage their cloud budgets rather than reacting to unexpected invoices.

- **Security and Governance**: Unexpected cost spikes can indicate security breaches, such as cryptocurrency mining on compromised resources.

### Best Practices for Implementing Billing Alerts

#### General Recommendations

1. **Set Expected Monthly or Daily Spend Alerts**

    - Define alerts based on projected cloud spend at the tenant level

    - Use daily alerts for high-risk environments and monthly alerts for general oversight.

1. **Require Alerts for all new Cloud Tenants**

    - Enforce a rule that all newly provisioned accounts, subscriptions, or projects must have at least one cost alert configured as part of the [Tenant Provisioning](../tenant-management/tenant-provisioning.md) process.

1. **Allow Customization of Alerts**

    - Enable application teams to adjust alert thresholds as project requirements change.

    - Provide guidelines on how to set realistic and actionable alerts.

1. **Monitor Cost Trends and Forecasts**

    - Provide applications teams with access to historical cost data and trend analysis to refine alert thresholds, see [Monthly cloud tenant billing report](./monthly-cloud-tenant-billing-report.md).

    - Encourage teams to set additional forecast-based alerts to detect anomalies before they exceed budgets.

1. **Ensure Alerts Reach the Right People**

    - Configure alerts to notify responsible engineers, FinOps teams, and leadership if necessary. You can simplify this process by automating integration with a [Cloud Tenant Database](../tenant-management/cloud-tenant-database.md) that holds this information.

    - Use multiple notification channels such as email, Slack, Microsoft Teams, or incident management tools.

### Implementation on Cloud Platforms

All major public cloud platforms provide built-in cost monitoring and alerting mechanisms:

- [**AWS¬†Budgets**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cost-management/latest/userguide/budgets-managing-costs.html):

    - Create budget-based alerts for actual or forecasted spend.

    - Notify users via email, SNS, or AWS Chatbot.

- [**Azure¬†Budgets**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/cost-mgt-alerts-monitor-usage-spending):

    - Set budget alerts for subscriptions, resource groups, or management groups.

    - Configure notifications via email, action groups, or automation workflows.

- [**Google¬†Cloud¬†Budgets¬†& Alerts**](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs/how-to/budgets):

    - Create budgets with thresholds for actual or forecasted spend.

    - Configure alerts via email or Pub/Sub for automated responses.

### Conclusion

Billing alerts are a crucial capability for cloud foundation teams to manage costs effectively. By enforcing proactive alerting, allowing customization, and integrating with automation, organizations can gain better control over cloud spending and prevent unnecessary financial surprises. Implementing best practices across AWS, Azure, and GCP ensures consistent cost governance across multi-cloud environments.

> ðŸ’¡ Building Blocks are the **fundamental capabilities** that a Cloud Foundation can provide.

Not all building blocks might be necessary for a cloud foundation that satisfies an organisation's requirements. This needs to be answered according to the organisation's unique requirements. We advocate an agile and iterative approach.

### Journey Stage

> ðŸ’¡ Each Building Block has a Journey Stage. The Journey Stage is a subjective measure of how advanced a capability is for the majority of Cloud Foundations.

Maturity in different categories, based on our experience.

From 1-5 stars. It's expected that not all aspects of a cloud foundation target about the same level of maturity.

### Scope

> ðŸ’¡ Each Building Block has a different scope.

- **Core** : Building blocks that are centrally enforced and across all cloud platforms.

- **Platform:** Building blocks that need to be individually implemented for each cloud platform.

- **Landing Zone:** Building blocks that need to be individually implemented for each landing zone.

### Cluster

> ðŸ’¡ Clusters help grouping related building Blocks

Building a cloud foundation needs to cover many different aspects. We organise building blocks into clusters to help discover related capabilities more quickly, e.g. Chargeback or IAM.

### Implementation Maturity

> ðŸ’¡ Each building block can be implemented in different levels of automation.

- **Manual** : Operator executes operations by hand.

- **Semi-Automated:** Operators execute operations using a script. Execution and parameterisation of the script manually.

- **Fully Automated:** Execution and parameterisation of the operation are fully automated. Operators only oversee the aggregate operation of the automation.

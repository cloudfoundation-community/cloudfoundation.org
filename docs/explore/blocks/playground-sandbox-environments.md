  summary: >-
    DevOps Teams / Developers can quickly provision cloud environments for
    experimentation / learning, thereby accelerating an organization's cloud
    journey. Playgrounds use relaxed policies (e.g. more cloud services are
    allowed) but come with time- or spend-limits that are tightly controlled.
    Expired playgrounds are automatically deprovisioned.

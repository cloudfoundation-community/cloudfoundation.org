    DevOps Teams / Developers can quickly provision cloud environments for
    experimentation / learning, thereby accelerating an organization's cloud
    journey. Playgrounds use relaxed policies (e.g. more cloud services are
    allowed) but come with time- or spend-limits that are tightly controlled.
    Expired playgrounds are automatically deprovisioned.

## What is a sandbox environment?





## Why use a sandbox environment?





## Challenges / best practices of sandbox environments





Sandbox Environments are a powerful tool for enabling DevOps teams to learn more about the cloud in a secure and isolated environment. Sandbox environments are a special type of environment that leverages various mechanisms to reduce the risk of overspending and shadow IT. The following best practices are recommended when enabling sandbox environments for DevOps teams:

- Automatically deprovisioning sandbox cloud tenants after a mandatory timeframe. This prevents shadow IT from appearing in the organization and not being cleaned up.

- Setting a spending limit on cloud tenants that are handed out for sandbox purposes. This prevents overspending on cloud services and forces teams to think twice about incurring costs when consuming cloud services and eliminates the risks of unwanted cloud bills.

- Providing relaxed policies when it comes to what cloud services the DevOps teams are able to consume. This is not a problem as the sandbox cloud tenants are isolated from any other development or production cloud tenants.

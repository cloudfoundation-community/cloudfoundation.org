## What is a modular landing zone?

Landing Zones describes how a cloud tenant should be prepared before DevOps teams can access it.

Modular Landing Zones are made up of required and optional components.

## Why modular landing zones?

Common examples for required components are

- Policies that need to be applied on tenant and resource level

- Access management

Common examples for optional components are

- [Managed Key Vault](/explore/blocks/managed-key-vault.md) 

- [Managed CI/CD Platform](/explore/blocks/managed-cicd-platform.md)

- [On-Premise Network Connection](/explore/blocks/on-premise-network-connection.md)

Already a small number of components can lead to a large number of combinations of those components.

Modular Landing Zones allow tailoring Landing Zones to the needs of every DevOps team while keeping redundancy low and complexity manageable.

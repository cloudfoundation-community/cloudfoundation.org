    Enable cloud customers within your organisation to take advantage of cloud
    provider cost optimisation opportunities available on individual cloud
    tenants like instance reservations. The chargeback process considers any
    resulting pre-payments and benefits out of these reservations. A system is
    in place to manage associated risks (e.g. budget authorization,
    overcommitment, lack of budget).

Pay-per-use is an essential pillar of cloud computing. The freedom to allocate resources dynamically and at any time must be balanced by an incentive mechanism that helps ensure consumers only allocate the actually needed resources. Internal billing on a pay-per-use model achieves this.

Not doing a pay-per-use pricing model such as shared cost, or fixed cost contributions lead down a path of treating a cloud platform in a "non-cloud" way - just like with other legacy IT infrastructure. This throws many of the benefits of cloud out of the window. Private cloud platforms thus often fail to meet the goals set out (e.g. cost savings due to higher resource utilization are not attained when customers can free-ride on the platform → "eh-da-kosten")



Common methods to arrive at pricing models

- study the public cloud market for typical pricing models (e.g. charge per vCPU, RAM, storage for IaaS, charge by RAM for PaaS)

- calculate prices according to CAPEX/OPEX cost of the cloud platform and expected usage

The Cloud Foundation Maturity Model is an abstraction of recurring themes in hundreds and hundreds of conversations with organizations that are on different stages of their Enterprise Cloud Journey. It captures the capabilities that organizations need to build in order to succeed at empowering DevOps teams with access to cloud infrastructure and services while staying in control. 

The Cloud Foundation Maturity Model is **implementation agnostic**. While meshcloud initially created model and offers a Cloud Foundation Platform, the model is concerned with ‚Äúwhat capabilities are offered‚Äù and not ‚Äúhow are they implemented‚Äù.

## Structure of the Cloud Foundation Maturity Model

In the Cloud Foundation Maturity Model capabilities are called building blocks. The term ‚Äúbuilding block‚Äù emphasizes, that building a cloud foundation is a matter of putting together the right blocks (think LEGO) out of the variety of blocks that you could use. The essence of a building block is laid out in [What is a Building Block](/maturity-model/what-is-a-building-block.md).

The model also captures how building blocks relate to each other. They are clustered in pillars of functionality like Tenant Management or IAM, can have dependencies (e.g. building a capability on top of another) and are assigned a ‚Äújourney stage‚Äù that helps cloud foundation teams identify the capabilities that are relevant to them right now.
